## UIC ECE464 (Fall 2023) Project 2: SCOAP vs. MC simulation
The goal of this project is to evaluate whether the controllability metric
(c0, c1) of SCOAP method is a good way to estimate the probability for each
output node to take 1 or 0, among some random input combinations.

## Your program should be able to do the following tasks:

1) Perform SCOAP controllability calculation  
• Compute (c0, c1) for each node, and show the results in a nice
format.  
2) Perform Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation  
• For each run, use 1000 random input patterns (each bit
generated with equal probability of being 0 or 1), collect the
number of times each output node has value 0, or 1 (m0, m1) –
this is called the Monte-Carlo simulation. Show the input and
results in a nice format.
